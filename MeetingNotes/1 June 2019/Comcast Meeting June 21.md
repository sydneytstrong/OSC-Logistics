# Meeting notes for {6-21-19}
Laurent discussed presentation, Larry posed initial backlash to focus on commercial tools Snyk and SourceClear. Larry later found interest in Aratha and similar tools. After presentation, a live meeting and demo was planned for early August. Later in the fall would be a possible CTF to teach comcast engineers how to use our methodology.
