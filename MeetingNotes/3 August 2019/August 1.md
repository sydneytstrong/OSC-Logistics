# Meeting notes for {8-1-19}
Alex started by showing his updates to the search tool. He ran it on the 50 packages with the dependents and not just their sources. Ahmad will send him a few lines of python so he can run it on the source files.  

The depot vulnerability in chai.js was found to be a false positive and not exploitable on the server side. Jade has two vulnerabilities. The case with `throw Stop` is a false positive and the other that reads a file and is a true positive that Alex will try and exploit. 

The slides for the Comcast meeting were looked over.

### New Deliverables for Next Meeting (8-2-19 @ 1100 & 1300 hrs)
- Run the tool on the sources for the 50 packages (Alex)
- Try and exploit the jade example to show comcast (Alex)
- Work on the slide deck for the comcast meeting tomorrow (Professors)
