# Meeting notes for {8-19-19}

Alex, Amir, Laurent, and Ahmad met to discuss the comcast meeting last Friday and what to work on next. Laurent started by saying how well the meeting went, and even Larry was happy with what we showed them. Now need to submit a CVE for the vulneralbities we found. Second, the Prototype package used by Comcast is a different version on GitHub that is no longer on node. Ahmad has looked into this a little and some vulnerabilities are still there and some more might have been added. This will be a good test for our tool to see if we can find these new spots Ahmad saw. For the next meeting, all the writeups should be finished up and put together for the presentation.

Some talk went into securing funding to continue this project with Comcast so a graduate student could research this methodology more for a paper. More research would include other types of attacks and apply this to a wider range of open source projects that could be automated. These ideas can be brought up in the next Comcast meeting at the end of the month. 

Amir returns tomorrow. Our next meeting will be Wednesday at 4pm.

Alex ran through a dry run of how the demos will go. The debugger will be used to walk Comcast through what is happening and how the payload is being passed through and executed by the package. Each demo should be relatively short and to the point. Practice tonight so that at the practice meeting at 12:30pm tomorrow we can iron out any details before the Comcast call at 1pm.

### New Deliverables for Next Meeting (8-21-19 @ 1600 hrs)
- Look into a CVE for the sinks we found
- Run our tool on the PrototypeJS version (Alex)
