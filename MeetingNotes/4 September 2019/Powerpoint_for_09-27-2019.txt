	# Current Findings
	Patterns the tool is searching for:
	* ` eval()`
	* `obj[var].call()`
	* `obj[var].apply()`
	* `obj[var] ()`

	# Packages Breakdown
	| Total # of Packages | Sink Finder Results               | Percentage                          |
	| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
	| 50                  | 15 (+7 external dependencies)     | 22% (44% incl. additional packages) |

	# File Breakdown
	| True Positives | Level 1 Interests | False Positives | Total # of Files |
	| :------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: |
	|     4 (1%)     |     18 (49%)      |    22 (50%)     |        44        |

	### Example of a common false positive
	```javascript
	this.history[options.replace ? 'replaceState' : 'pushState']({}, document.title, url);
	```

	Easy to eliminate because the attribute that history calls can only be one of two literals.

	# Retrospective:
		* Method is informative, but slow (manual).
		* Automation will save time and provide more metrics.
#+End_slide4

#+Slide5
	# Sink Finder Tool Extension:
		* Tool currently searches local sources and reports sinks.
		* A database should be used to contain logistic, installation, and testing data.
		* Tool can then cross-reference across runs for more comprehensive data.
#+End_slide5

#+Slide6
	Purpose of Extension:
	  * Verify that the tool is reliable in finding other documented vulnerabilities.
		* Make the manual testing process an automated one.
		* Track the progression of sinks across repository versions.
#+End_slide6

#+Slide7
	Automation Benefits:
		* Enhance speed and efficiency of future development.
		* Higher volume of test cases.
		* Facilitates easier tool modification.
		* Simplifies integration of our system.
#+End_slide7

#+Slide8
	Process procedure:
		* Obtain the information for packages containing a specific vulnerability from online DBs.
		* Run main tool on the known exploitable packages, then assess if vulnerabilities were found.
		* Evaluate/improve tool search pattern for vulnerability type based on findings from previous step.

	#Next Steps for Scrubber Tool
		* interface with more databases for more test cases
		* Expand filtering for more vulnerabilities
		* Gather Statistics of tool performance
#+End_slide12

#+Slide13
	Next Steps for Sink Tool finder
		* Use results from scrubber to find more sinks and reduce false positives.
		* Improve SQL and command injection patterns.
		* Verify the tool doesn't miss any patterns.
