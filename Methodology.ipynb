    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to evaluate the security of Open Source Components (OSCs), and ideally, to find any existing vulnerability - mainly in server-based JavaScript code. For now, we focus only on three main type of injection vulnerabilities: code injection, command injection and SQL injections. \n",
    "\n",
    "Injection vulnerabilities share a basic structure: \n",
    "\\begin{itemize}\n",
    "\\item An injection point, where the attacker may provide the injection code as input\n",
    "\\item Attack surface: intermediate code via which the injection code is passed, and possibly modified, but not sanitized (removed)\n",
    "\\item An activation point, where the attacker's input is applied as part of a system function, resulting in the (code/command/SQL) injection. \n",
    "\\end{itemize}\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate OSCs and find vulnerabilities, we will develop one or more tools, and apply them as part of a manual analysis of OSCs. At this phase of the project, we focus on the activation-point search tool. \n",
    "In this document, we discuss (1) the process for developing the activation-point search tool, (2) the plan and tools we will use to evaluate and find vulnerabilities in a given OSC using the activation-point search tool, and (3) our plan for completing this phase of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is that by searching for activation points, we make it significantly easier to evaluate if a given OSC is vulnerable to injection attacks, since every injection vulnerability must involve an activation point. Code which has no activation point, does not require any further analysis - and we expect this to be the case for some OSCs and definitely for most of the code within an OSC. \n",
    "\n",
    "An activation point involves calling specific functions or methods or specific packages. Any such invocation is invariably expressed via a piece of syntax that is recognizable. It is, of course, also clear that not all such activation points are vulnerable. When used safely, the activation point can achieve its intended effect without introducing any risks. The _safe use_ of the activation point is a consequence of the context within which the potentially dangerous activation point is used. This context is driven by the surrounding syntax as well as the invocation environment. Rooting out false positives is therefore a process that must examine this dynamic context which typically involves one or more execution paths connecting program or script inputs to the potentially dangerous activation point. A subset of these paths may prove benign (e.g., when the inputs are shown to be constants). The surviving (and therefore still potentially dangerous) paths need to be subjected to one last phase of analysis that reasons about the relationships between input values and the payload at the activation point.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the OSC evaluation process\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an activation point does not necessarily imply existance of a vulnerability in a given OSC; once we find an activation point, we will need to perform further analysis to know if there is also a corresponding injection point allowing the attacker to inject the code to be activated. This further analysis involves two steps: flow analysis, which involves finding the attack surface and corresponding injection points, and semantic analysis, which finds if the attacker may actually perform an injection attack using these injection points, attack surface (intermediate code) and activation points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the proposed method is therefore based on 3 phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finding activation points using a static (syntax) analysis tool. The goal of the tool is to find activation points in the source code. For a package under test, the output is a set of potentially dangerous activation points. \n",
    "- Finding the corresponding attack surface using flow analysis (currently semi-manually, later possibly using an automation tool). The goal is to trace back, through the control flow graph as well as the call graph, the set of paths leading to an activation point and sourced at some user input (injection point). Potentially dangerous sites whose path \"dead-end\" into specific constructions (like constant declaration) may be filtered out as a result. For the package under test, the output is the subset of still potentially dangerous activation points, each one supported by a (non-empty) set of paths connecting user inputs (injection points) to the activation point.\n",
    "- Semantic analysis: It's purpose is to reason about each path to establish the relationships between the inputs and the payload delivered at the activation point. Each symbolic step in the execution of the program along this path can potentially transform or affect the input and reduce or altogether neuter the potency of an attack that would be delivered through the input of that path. This analysis can be carried out with a variety of techniques ranging from test generation, to model checking and constraint reasoning. \n",
    "\n",
    "As of \\today{}, the implementation provides a working (albeit not as powerful as we wish) syntax analysis tool to find activation points. The tasks laid out between now and August 15 focus on improving this analysis to cover more patterns as identified in known, reported security vulnerabilities, and applying the tool and additional tools to evaluate several OSCs and find possible vulnerabilities in them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In future work (Fall'19) we plan to develop an automated or semi-automated tool for finding the injection-points and attack-surface connecting injection-points to invocation-points, via analysis in the CFG/CG, and to develop methodology for semantic analysis and apply the entire process to additional OSCs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vulnerabilities under consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "We re-interate that in this project we focus on three classes of injection vulnerabilities, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Javascript code injection\n",
    "2. OS command injection\n",
    "3. SQL code injection\n",
    "\n",
    "This is to focus the conversation and the effort and is no way a limitation of the approach. These are classic and apparently the most common vulnerabilities. Addressing them effectively can establish the validity of the approach and provides useful results."

    "# The activation-point search tool\n",
    "\n",
    "An injection vulnerability, by definition, involves one or more activation-points, i.e., locations where the injected code is activated (executed). For example, a code-injection vulnerability may be due to an eval statement in the code, where the input was controlled by the attacker; that statement is the activation point. In order to automatically find security vulnerabilities in Javascript code fragments, we develop a tool to find potential activation-points, i.e., lines of code which involve activation (execution) based on any variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic approach: finding activation points via syntax analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach considered here is fairly straightforward. First, it is necessary to parse `Javascript` source files and obtain an Abstract Syntax Tree. Subsequent traversals can find the site of interest and filter out those that do not meet specific criteria.

    "\n",
    " We discovered that the core templates used initially do not necessarily cover all the constructions that allow injections in Javascript. In particular, the initial implementation proved unable to locate vulnerabilities in versions of libraries known to have a specific issue. \n",
    " \n",
    "We developed the following methodology to find additional - hopefully, all - patterns allowing injections in Javascript. Namely, we will identify a collection of OSCs with known (injection) vulnerabilities; apply the invocation-point finding tool to each of them; and whenever it fails, we will analyze to identify the additional javascript construct allowing injection and not found by the tool - and extend the tool to find this additional pattern of invocation-point in addition to its current set. We repeat the process until we find at least one injection point in each vulnerable OSC. This methodology is described in more details below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding vulnerable Open Source Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is to wade through the collection of open-source components and use a vulnerability database such as: [https://snyk.io](https://snyk.io). to find example of libraries that contain a known injection vulnerability. This process is applied continuously to build a list of __challenges__ for the template finder. For each such challenge, the finder is applied. If it finds corresponding injection points, the sample is uninteresting (appears not to contain new injection-point patterns). However, if an injection-point is not identified, it is necessary to analyze the nature of the vulnerability and understand what Javascript construction the developer adopted that allowed injection (and was not found), and to add the necessary detection logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we are unaware of an automatic tool for extracting real vulnerabilities from public databases, we have manually searched for such vulnerabilites. We use them to challege our template finder and enhance it everytime it fails the challenge. The remainder of the section shows such vulnerable packages. For each case we provide its package name, vulnerable version, candidate spot, and the path that leads to that spot.\n",
