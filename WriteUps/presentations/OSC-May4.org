* CVE Classification
*** Last Time
- Generated frequency distributions over 34 injection CVE
- Manually decided relevant terms via ranking by highest frequency
- Scored relevancy of rest of database by occurence of these terms

*** Results From Last Time
- Many entries scored highly, suggesting relevant terms were not specific enough
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6cm
[[./figures/freq_res.png]]

*** Refining Search Method
- Determined set of distinquishing terms.
- Distinguishing terms = Common in sample, uncommon in random sample
- Results seem near identical to manually identified terms
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6cm
[[./figures/monogram-distinguished-frequency.png]]

*** Refining Search Method cont'd.
- Same process was used to find frequency distribution of bi-grams from
  relevant CVE summaries
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6cm
[[./figures/bigram-sample-frequency.png]]

*** Bigram Occurence Analysis Results
- Less CVEs were found, but found to have more relevance
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[./figures/bigram-analysis-results.png]]

*** Example: CVE-2018-3772
- Entered in Database as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)
- While true, this vulnerability can lead to a Command Injection attack, as mentioned in description:
- "Concatenating unsanitized user input in the `whereis` npm module <
  0.4.1 allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The
  `whereis` module is deprecated and it is recommended to use the
  `which` npm module instead."

*** Next Step
 - Bigram Analysis seems more precise, but yeilds fewer results.
 - Continue manual analysis of high scoring CVEs from monogram (one-word term) analysis.
 - Weighting for distiguishing terms.


* LGTM
*** Where We Left Off
- Expand set of queries for Code Injection
- Analyze the other packages we used the sink finder on
- Consider possible automation of this process.

*** What's New
- Major Advancement in automation for CodeQL 
- Why? 
  - "Feed two birds with one scone"
  - Free up resources to focus on expanding set of queries 
  - Able to analyze other packages faster
  - reduce operation time for evaluating query performance and JS packages
  - Modularity for easier troubleshooting 
  
*** CodeQL automation capablities 
- Set up uniform File-Directory structure for easier troubleshooting and accessiblity
- Applies Query(ies) to JS packages
  - Able to specify versions
  - If you do not have the package, it will extract it for you automatically
- Groups different versions of packages together
- Sets up CodeQL Databases, query compliation, and run the query automatically
- Able to clean and reconstruct CodeQL Databases for optimal disk management and to avoid dependencies issues 

*** Next Steps
- Revise documentation 
- Fix edge case bugs
- Verify query results
- Expand sets of queries 


* OSC Benchmark

*** Where We Left Off
- Build a JavaScript benchmark library with synthetic examples to mimic OWASP's benchmarks
- Tests are either a true or false positive
- Currently 9 benchmarks:
- Automatically generates scorecards


*** What's New
- Working with Kerwin on the LGTM script
  - Will run our custom quieres on a target directory


*** Next Step
- Integrating LGTM driver script to use the scorecard generation script

* CVE-ID Registration
*** CVE-ID Registration
- Learned the process for submitting a CVE-ID request
- For most vulnerabilties, contact the appropriate CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) and give appropriate info:
 - Usually need vulnerability type, a description, impact, and affected products (including version)
- If a CNA is not listed for a particular software, fill out request form on CVE website
*** Registering What We Have Found
- Collected data necessary to make CVE-ID requests for the following packages:
 - Jade
 - Depot
 - PrototypeJS
- CNA for all three packages is ~Nodejs~
- CVE request filed at ~cve-request@iojs.org~
*** Vulnerability Information Example (Depot)
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6cm
- Depot: code can be injected directly into input box succeeding a semicolon.
 - Vulnerability type: Server Side JS Injection
 - Affected product: Depot v0.1.6
 - Impact: Code Execution

* Summary
*** What We Have Done So Far
- Use Bigram analysis along with manual analysis in highest scoring cves
- Got the CLI for LGTM to work and using custom queries
- Created a scorescard to assess tool's reliability
- Submited the vulnerabilties we had found as CVEs
*** Questions?
- Questions and Comments?
